Welcome to the new BigWorld framework implemented in Cinder.

Couple of brief notes for getting started:

0.  Recommended Image naming:
(your_image_name).w_(your_image_width).h_(your_image_height).(extention)
example:
killer_bunny_glow.w_1920.h_1080.png

1.  You'll need two environment variables set:
CINDER should point to the current cinder dist (cinder_0.8.4_vc2010 as of this writing)
DS_PLATFORM should point to this repository.
QUICKTIME should point to quicktime dist (QuickTimeSDK-7.3 or whatever version is needed)

2.  You should currently start from one of the Cinder example apps as your base project.

3.  Client apps need these C++ includes:
$(DS_PLATFORM)\lib\poco\include
$(DS_PLATFORM)\src
$(CINDER)\blocks\tuio\include
$(CINDER)\blocks\osc\include

4.  Client apps need to link with these libraries:
4.1.  Debug
PocoFoundationmtd.lib
PocoNetmtd.lib
platform_d.lib
osc_d.lib // for tuio
CVClient.lib // for quicktime
QTMLClient.lib // for quicktime

4.1.2  Release
PocoFoundationmt.lib
PocoNetmt.lib
platform.lib
ocs.lib // for tuio
CVClient.lib // for quicktime
QTMLClient.lib // for quicktime

5.  Client apps need to include these link directories:
$(DS_PLATFORM)\lib\poco\lib\vs2010
$(DS_PLATFORM)\lib
$(CINDER)\blocks\osc\lib
$(QUICKTIME)\Libraries
