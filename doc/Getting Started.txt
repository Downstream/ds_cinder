Welcome to the new BigWorld framework implemented in Cinder.

Couple of brief notes for getting started:

1.  You'll need two environment variables set:
CINDER should point to the current cinder dist (cinder_0.8.4_vc2010 as of this writing)
DS_PLATFORM should point to this repository.

2.  You should currently start from one of the Cinder example apps as your base project.

3.  Client apps need these C++ includes:
$(DS_PLATFORM)\lib\poco\include
$(DS_PLATFORM)\src

4.  Client apps need to link with these libraries:
4.1.  Debug
PocoFoundationmtd.lib
PocoNetmtd.lib
platform_d.lib

4.1.2  Release
PocoFoundationmt.lib
PocoNetmt.lib
platform.lib

5.  Client apps need to include these link directories:
$(DS_PLATFORM)\lib\poco\lib\vs2010
$(DS_PLATFORM)\lib
