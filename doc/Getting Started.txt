Welcome to the new BigWorld framework implemented in Cinder.

Couple of brief notes for getting started:

1.  You'll need three environment variables set:
CINDER should point to the current cinder dist (cinder_0.8.4_vc2010 as of this writing)
DS_PLATFORM should point to this repository.
QUICKTIME should point to quicktime dist (QuickTimeSDK-7.3 or whatever version is needed)

2.  You should currently start by copying the example/starter as the basis for your new app.  If you do this, everything will be setup correctly and ready to go.

3.  If you DON'T do 2. and copy the starter project, then you will need to manually set up the new solution yourself.

 We are using Visual Studio property sheets to manage basic settings like libraries and include paths. The property sheets are located in ds_cinder/vc10/, PlatformSetup.props (release config) and PlatformSetup_d.props (debug config).  What this means is that in the future, all include paths, libraries, and library include paths should be added to these property sheets, so that apps will inherit any changes.  All of these values are specified in the property sheets Common Properties->User Macros page.

3.1.  Open the Property Manager (View -> Property Manager).
3.2.  For each project, in the Debug config add PlatformSetup_d.props and in release add PlatformSetup.props (in both cases, right click the config and select Add Existing Property Sheet...).
3.3.  In C/C++->General set Additional Include Directories to "$(platform_include_d)" (in debug) or "$(platform_include)" (in release)
3.4.  In Linker->General set Additional Library Directories to "$(platform_lib_include_d);%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)" (in debug) or "$(platform_lib_include);%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)" (in release)
3.5.  In Linker->Input set Additional Dependencies to "$(platform_lib_d);%(AdditionalDependencies)" (in debug) or "$(platform_lib);%(AdditionalDependencies)" (in release)
3.6.  In Linker->Input set Ignore Specific to "$(platform_lib_ignore_d)" (in debug) or "$(platform_lib_ignore)" (in release)
