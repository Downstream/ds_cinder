	<!-- Used to support multiple resolutions of the same app. If this value exists,
	then all settings files found in the supplied folder will get applied on top of
	their base files, including engine.xml.
	OK settings-file afficionados, what this means is that, for any given setting, it
	will be a composite of potentially up to four locations. They get applied in this
	order, so later items take precedence:
	1. %APP%\settings\...
	2. %APP%\settings\1920x1080\... (if the "configuration.xml:folder" setting exists, and
	its value is "1920x1080")
	3. C:\users\(user)\Documents\downstream\settings\(project_path)\...
	4. C:\users\(user)\Documents\downstream\settings\(project_path)\1920x1080\...
	-->
	<text name="folder" value="1920x1080" />
