# Starting a new app

## Clone an app

Assuming you've followed the Getting Started guide already and you're using Windows, go to ds_cinder/utility/ and run project_cloner.ps1 with PowerShell. Choose a destination, an app name, and a namespace.

Project Cloner duplicates the full_starter example app and updates all the names and namespaces. The app you'll get includes all the major extension projects (PDF, Web, Essentials, Physics, Video, Viewers), which you can delete if you don't need them. 

## Next Steps

Open the cloned project and get it compiled. From there, you'll want to setup your fonts, set any resource locations for sqlite databases, build layouts, and write any custom app logic. 

Each cloned project also includes an installer script for InnoSetup that automagically packages your app and dependencies into self-contained installer package.
