	<!-- Example settings for nine patches that can be used as drop shadow and rounded
	panel foreground. A nine patch config has four entries, each entry has a key that
	starts with a name uniquely identifying that nine patch and ends in a value specific
	to that entry. For example, if you have a nine patch named "panel:bg" then you would
	create settings for "panel:bg:type" "panel:bg:radius" etc. as below. -->

	<!-- PANEL BACKGROUND -->
		<!-- Image generation algorithm, currently must always be "arc drop shadow" -->
		<text  name="panel:bg:type" value="arc drop shadow" />
		<!-- Size of the corners, in pixels. -->
		<float name="panel:bg:radius" value="62" />
		<!-- Essentially a pow() function to shape the falloff towards the edges. -->
